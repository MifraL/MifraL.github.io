- Had the chance to look and play around with different tools such as dreamscape, scatterplot….

And gephi 
-	Did not work as well because there was no clutter as I had chosen the diary of the same person

- It was pretty great, the barcode was looking great I believe because the covers were mostly simple it showed the color tones better….
- I liked the visual impact.

Ocr

-	I had trouble with the code because I forgot to change jpg to png and putting the correct folder name into the code.

-	I tried doing a collage in the inkscape but it’s looked messy and childish so I did sound

StoryMap

![image i just uploaded](storymap1.JPG)

- The location were all the same for every diary so I couldn't maximize the potential of the storymap. So I tried sonification... 

Sound

-	Because the data was chosen by me, I understood the sound better… like how as the years progressed for 
the diary, the piano notes would rise.

Share the results of your explorations. Reflect on Michelle Moravec’s own cycle of exploration and what that might imply for yours.

- I first did the analysis of my data on voyant because I copied and pasted the link for each of them, 
there was limit that I couldn’t exceed. That was a bit disappointing because I would have loved to use more documents… 
It is what it is. Then I proceeded to Network (Databasic and Gephi), which did not work out as I expected because the source 
was one author, the end result was not messy and too clean for me to do much to it.

- So, I worked with image analysis, specifically for the covers of the diary. Since, the diaries mostly had one main color. 
The end result was differentiation between shades of color. It was really satisfying to see the organization. 

- Lastly, I did OCR. The coding in RStudio worked fine except for when I forgot to change the file type to png as well as 
the name of the new folder with the images of the cover. After I changed it, the code worked, and I got the output.txt and ocr.txt files. 

- Then to tie it all up, I was planning on doing a poster and I tried making a couple of them, but they ended up not looking 
that great, so I tried to do a different method. Which was to make a story map, and I almost was finished but then I 
realized that all the location was in the same city and country. That would defeat the purpose of showing her travels 
around the world. Then I figure why not do the sonification and it at least worked better than the others. The music notes 
went higher as the years for the cover progressed. It is nice tool to use when wanting to do something different than visualization.
As I did in my previous use of applications which were mostly about visuals, I though the sonification tool helped 
to showcase a different side to the data that I had picked. 

- I realized this week that when you’re choosing which applications to use, not all of them will give the 
results that you need. So, it is essential to be familiar with different types of programs so that as 
researcher one can choose the best one for their topic of study. I related a lot to Moravec’s article because 
she also went through choices of applications to use like between AntConc or Gephi… and picked the one most 
suited. It is an important lesson to remember because otherwise a lot of time will be wasted.
